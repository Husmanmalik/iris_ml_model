**Iris_Mechine Learning model:**
This dashboard employs a supervised machine learning model, specifically the Random Forest classification technique, to classify the species of iris flowers.Users can dynamically select input values in real-time using sliders. 
Once the input is received, the system converts it into a dataset and applies the Random Forest technique to predict the flower species. The dashboard also presents the prediction confidence as a percentage. 
Additionally, it incorporates various graphs illustrating relationships within the iris dataset, including a heatmap depicting correlations between different variables.
